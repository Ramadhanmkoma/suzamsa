## 1. Indentation and Formatting

- Use spaces for indentation (preferably 2 or 4 spaces).
- Maintain a consistent and readable code formatting style throughout the project.

## 2. Naming Conventions

- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., camelCase or snake_case).

## 3. Comments

- Include comments to explain complex logic or provide context where necessary.
- Avoid excessive or redundant comments; aim for self-explanatory code.

## 4. Variables and Constants

- Declare variables and constants with meaningful names.
- Use constants for values that don't change.
  
## 5. Functions and Methods

- Keep functions and methods concise and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use meaningful names that reflect the purpose of the function or method.

## 6. Error Handling

- Implement proper error handling to gracefully manage exceptions.
- Provide informative error messages to aid in debugging.

## 7. Testing

- Write unit tests for critical components and functionalities.
- Ensure tests cover edge cases and handle potential errors.

## 8. Documentation

- Document code using inline comments for clarity.
- Maintain a separate documentation file with an overview of the project structure, setup instructions, and other relevant details.

## 9. Git Workflow

- Follow a branching strategy (e.g., feature branches, develop, master).
- Write clear and concise commit messages.

Adhering to these coding standards will contribute to a cohesive and maintainable codebase for the SUZAMSA App. Thank you for your commitment to writing clean and high-quality code.
